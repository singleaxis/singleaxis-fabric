# SingleAxis Fabric

**A customer-controlled recorder for AI systems.**

Passively capture observable agent activity, protect it before export, and
reliably deliver a verifiable record to a destination you choose.

## One product, three responsibilities

```text
Agent or existing telemetry
            |
            v
      CAPTURE -> PROTECT -> DELIVER
            SingleAxis Fabric OSS
```

- **Capture** accepts OpenTelemetry from Fabric SDKs, framework adapters, an
  existing collector, or a customer integration.
- **Protect** applies a metadata-only export allowlist before telemetry crosses
  the customer boundary. Raw prompts, responses, tool payloads, headers,
  credentials, and tokens are denied by default.
- **Deliver** buffers and retries protected telemetry to the customer's own
  OTLP backend, a private SingleAxis deployment, or SingleAxis Platform.

The default deployment is passive shadow monitoring. Fabric does not block,
alter, or delay the monitored AI system.

## What ships

| Artifact | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Fabric SDKs | Optional Python and TypeScript instrumentation |
| Fabric Node | One OpenTelemetry Collector distribution for capture, protection, buffering, and delivery |
| `fabricctl` | Local recorder initialization, configuration validation, digest, help, and version |
| Public contracts | Activity, connection, privacy, recorder, and delivery interoperability |

A SingleAxis account is not required. You can deliver to infrastructure you
operate and inspect every component in the customer trust boundary.

## What does not ship in recorder v1

Recorder v1 does not install judges, red-team runners, prompt-time PII or
guardrail engines, policy enforcement, assurance tiers, regulatory profiles,
Decision Graph analytics, incident workflows, or an enterprise management UI.

Those are consumers of the record or optional later runtime capabilities:

```text
Fabric OSS                 SingleAxis Platform          Optional later runtime
CAPTURE -> PROTECT ->      MONITOR -> EVALUATE ->       ENFORCE
DELIVER                    GOVERN
```

Older implementations may remain visible in repository source history while
they are migrated. They are not compiled into recorder binaries, bundled in the
recorder chart, or enabled by the installer.

## Start locally

Install the Python SDK when you control the agent code:

```bash
pip install "singleaxis-fabric[otlp]"
```

Send spans to a local Fabric Node:

```bash
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
```

```python
import os

from fabric import Fabric, FabricConfig, install_default_provider
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter

install_default_provider(
    service_name="claims-assistant",
    exporter=OTLPSpanExporter(
        endpoint=os.environ["OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT"] + "/v1/traces"
    ),
)

fabric = Fabric(
    FabricConfig(tenant_id="example", agent_id="claims-assistant")
)

with fabric.decision(session_id="session-1", request_id="request-1") as decision:
    with decision.llm_call(provider="example", model="example-model") as call:
        response = run_your_agent()
        call.set_usage(input_tokens=10, output_tokens=20, finish_reason="stop")
```

If you do not control the agent code, send its existing OTLP telemetry to the
Fabric Node or place a supported telemetry gateway outside its request path.
See [integration models](docs/integration-models.md).

## Configure the recorder

Run the local wizard:

```bash
fabricctl init
```

It writes a recorder configuration without credentials and reports that the
configuration is prepared, not installed. Review it before applying any
deployment change.

For Kubernetes evaluation:

```bash
helm dependency build charts/fabric
helm upgrade --install fabric charts/fabric \
  --namespace fabric-system \
  --create-namespace \
  --values charts/fabric/profiles/shadow-dev.yaml
```

`shadow-dev` is intentionally non-production. The `shadow-production` profile
requires the operator to provide authenticated TLS ingress, authenticated HTTPS
egress, persistent storage, and explicit ingress and exporter network peers.
The chart must refuse an incomplete production configuration.

## Security posture

- Metadata-only protection is the default export mode.
- Fabric Node does not sample accepted audit traffic; upstream systems may
  still have their own sampling or blind spots.
- Production delivery uses persistent queue storage and at-least-once export;
  destinations must deduplicate using preserved trace/span identity or
  identities added by an adapter.
- Queued, transmitted, destination-accepted, and durably-persisted are distinct
  concepts in the public delivery contract. Fabric Node does not automatically
  emit a durable-persistence receipt, and HTTP success is not such proof.
- Fabric does not claim that metadata-only export, by itself, satisfies legal
  de-identification requirements. Customers remain responsible for data
  classification, retention, lawful basis, and destination controls.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for vulnerability reporting and
[the recorder specification](specs/027-recorder-v1.md) for release gates.

## Project status

Recorder v1 is being qualified for enterprise testing. Treat release candidates
as pre-production until the published qualification report confirms privacy,
durability, restart, retry, duplicate-delivery, and fail-closed profile tests.
See the current [qualification status](docs/recorder-v1-qualification-status.md)
for the distinction between implemented behavior, public contracts, and checks
that require the tagged release CI environment.
